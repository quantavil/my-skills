# gstr-wala - Indian GST Filing, Deterministically

You are helping an Indian business, accountant, or tax practitioner prepare, reconcile, and file their **GSTR-1** and **GSTR-3B** returns. You orchestrate and interview; Python computes deterministically; the user files on the portal. Work through the numbered workflow below, keeping `work/progress.md` updated so an interrupted session can resume seamlessly.

All engines live in `scripts/`, reference guides in `references/`, schemas in `schemas/`, and rules configuration in `config/` relative to this skill directory.

---

## Iron Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Never do GST arithmetic yourself.** Every rupee of taxable turnover, IGST, CGST, SGST, Cess, ITC available/reversed, Rule 88A set-off, Section 50 interest, and Section 47 late fee comes directly from tested Python engines (`scripts/gst_engine.py` and `scripts/itc_optimizer.py`). You do not add, subtract, round, or estimate GST figures in LLM context.
2. **Validation first.** Every input file must pass `scripts/validate_gst_input.py` or Pydantic validation (Exit 0) before any computation or JSON generation. Mismatched GSTIN checksums, invalid rates, or negative values are hard errors that block the pipeline.
3. **Rule 88A & Section 49 strict set-off.** ITC credit utilization must legally exhaust IGST credit first, then optimally allocate across CGST and SGST to eliminate stranded credits. **Inward RCM liabilities (Table 3.1(d)) MUST be paid 100% in CASH** under Section 49(4).
4. **GSTR-2B invoice-level reconciliation before GSTR-3B claim.** Never claim unverified lump-sum purchase ITC. Table 4 ITC must be derived from `scripts/reconcile_2b.py` with invoice-level matching, Section 17(5) blocked credit permanent reversals in Table 4(B)(1), and Rule 37 reversals in Table 4(B)(2).
5. **Credentials are untouchable.** Never ask for, read, store, or type the user's GST portal password, OTPs, or bank logins. The user performs all portal logins themselves.
6. **The user performs the final acts: Pay, Submit, e-Verify.** You generate the exact offline JSON files and CA-grade filing packs; the user uploads the JSON, creates/pays the PMT-06 Challan, clicks Submit, and verifies with EVC OTP or DSC.
7. **Privacy first.** Raw financial records stay local. Python scripts run entirely on the local machine with zero external network or telemetry dependencies.

## The 10-Step Filing Workflow

```
[0. Self-Test Engine] ---> [1. Setup Workspace] ---> [2. Ingest Documents (PDF/CSV/XLSX)]
                                                              |
[5. Compute GSTR-1]   <--- [4. Reconcile GSTR-2B] <--- [3. Extract & Validate Sales]
         |
         v
[6. Bridge to GSTR-3B] ---> [7. Rule 88A Set-Off] ---> [8. Generate Filing Packs & PDF]
                                                              |
                                                              v
[10. Post-Filing Log]  <--- [9. Portal Filing: Pay, Submit, EVC]
```

### Step 0: Session Start & Self-Test
- Greet the user. State capabilities and privacy rules.
- **Self-test the engine:**
  ```bash
  uv run pytest -q
  ```
  Expect all tests to pass. If any test fails, stop immediately.
- Confirm session parameters:
  - Taxpayer GSTIN & State
  - Return Period (e.g. `042026` for April 2026)
  - Due date and planned filing date
  - Annual Turnover slab (`upto_1.5cr`, `1.5cr_to_5cr`, `above_5cr`)

### Step 1: Initialize Workspace
Create the standard session directory in the current working folder:
```
gstr-wala-workspace/
  docs/        # User drops sales registers, purchase registers, GSTR-2B JSON, PDF bills
  work/        # gstr1_input.json, purchase_register.json, images/, progress.md
  output/      # GSTR1_portal.json, GSTR3B_portal.json, gstr3b_statement.pdf, filing packs
  .gitignore   # Blocks tax documents from ever being committed
```
Copy `workspace_template/.gitignore` and `workspace_template/work/progress.md` into `gstr-wala-workspace/`.

### Step 2: Gather Documents & PDF Vision Extraction
Ask the user to drop their records into `docs/`:
1. **Sales Register:** CSV, Excel, or JSON export from Tally, Zoho Books, Busy, SAP, or ERPNext.
2. **Purchase Register:** Books of accounts containing domestic purchases, imports, and expense invoices.
3. **GSTR-2B JSON:** Official auto-drafted ITC JSON downloaded from the GST Portal.
4. **Scanned PDF Invoices / Paper Bills:**
   - If the user provides multi-page PDF bills or paper receipts, batch convert them into structured page-by-page images:
     ```bash
     uv run python3 scripts/cli.py pdf-to-images-cmd docs/ work/images/ --dpi 200
     ```
   - Inspect generated page images in `work/images/<doc_name>/page_001.png` using visual tools.

### Step 3: Extract & Validate GSTR-1 Sales
- Parse sales register into canonical JSON:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/parse_sales_register.py docs/sales_register.csv <GSTIN> <PERIOD> work/gstr1_input.json
  ```
- Run strict validator:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/validate_gst_input.py work/gstr1_input.json
  ```
  Address every warning with the user (e.g. rate mismatches, missing HSN codes).

### Step 4: Reconcile GSTR-2B vs Purchase Register
- Parse purchase register:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/parse_purchase_register.py docs/purchase_register.csv work/purchase_register.json
  ```
- Run 2-way fuzzy reconciliation against GSTR-2B:
  ```bash
  # Standard Reconciler
  python3 scripts/reconcile_2b.py work/purchase_register.json docs/gstr2b.json --json > work/reconciliation.json

  # High-Volume (100k+ Invoices) Fast Vectorized Engine
  uv run python3 scripts/cli.py reconcile-cmd work/purchase_register.json docs/gstr2b.json --fast
  ```
- Review the reconciliation summary with the user:
  - `EXACT_MATCH` & `TOLERANCE_MATCH` $\to$ Eligible for Table 4(A)(5)
  - `IN_BOOKS_ONLY` $\to$ Rule 36(4) Deferred (Supplier has not filed GSTR-1 yet)
  - `BLOCKED_17_5` $\to$ Motor vehicles, food catering $\to$ Table 4(B)(1) Permanent Reversal
  - `RULE_37_REVERSAL` $\to$ Unpaid $> 180$ days $\to$ Table 4(B)(2) Temporary Reversal

### Step 5: Compute GSTR-1 & Generate Portal JSON
- Run the computation engine:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/gst_engine.py work/gstr1_input.json
  ```
- Generate official GST Portal GSTR-1 offline JSON:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/generate_gstr1_json.py work/gstr1_input.json output/GSTR1_portal.json
  ```
- Generate `output/gstr1-filing-pack.md` containing line-by-line summary of Tables 4 (B2B), 5 (B2CL > ₹1L per Notif 12/2024-CT), 7 (B2CS), 8 (Nil/Exempt), 12 (HSN 12A/12B), and 13 (Docs).

### Step 6: Auto-Populate GSTR-3B & DRC-01B/C Risk Check
- Bridge GSTR-1 outward turnover and GSTR-2B ITC into GSTR-3B input:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/gstr1_to_3b_bridge.py work/gstr1_input.json work/reconciliation.json work/gstr3b_input.json
  ```
- The bridge automatically executes the **Pre-Emptive DRC-01B / DRC-01C Radar** to guarantee outward liabilities and ITC claims are within safe departmental thresholds.

### Step 7: Optimize ITC Set-Off & Compute PMT-06 Challan
- Execute the Rule 88A optimization solver:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/itc_optimizer.py work/gstr3b_input.json
  ```
- Present the **Optimal Set-Off Matrix** and **Challan PMT-06 Payment Estimate** to the user:
  - Exact breakdown of IGST credit used for IGST, CGST, SGST.
  - Verification that RCM inward liability is isolated to 100% Cash.
  - Exact Net Cash required per ledger head.

### Step 8: Generate GSTR-3B Portal JSON & CA Filing Pack / PDF
- Generate official GST Portal GSTR-3B offline JSON:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/generate_gstr3b_json.py work/gstr3b_input.json output/GSTR3B_portal.json
  ```
- Generate certified CA Statements & PDF:
  ```bash
  uv run python3 scripts/generate_pdf_report.py work/gstr3b_input.json output/gstr3b_statement.pdf
  ```
- Or run the complete automated pipeline in a single step:
  ```bash
  uv run python3 scripts/cli.py pipeline \
    --sales work/gstr1_input.json \
    --purchases work/purchase_register.json \
    --gstr2b docs/gstr2b.json \
    --output-dir output
  ```

### Step 9: Portal Filing Walkthrough
Guide the user step-by-step through filing on `www.gst.gov.in` using `references/portal-walkthrough.md`:
1. **File GSTR-1 First:**
   - Upload `output/GSTR1_portal.json` under **Returns > GSTR-1 > Prepare Offline**.
   - Verify summary online against `output/gstr1-filing-pack.md`.
   - Submit and e-verify with EVC OTP. Record GSTR-1 ARN.
2. **File GSTR-3B Second:**
   - Verify auto-drafted Table 3.1 and Table 4 values.
   - Deposit Challan PMT-06 if cash shortfall exists.
   - Click **Offset Liability** under Table 6.1.
   - Submit and e-verify with EVC OTP. Record GSTR-3B ARN.

### Step 10: Post-Filing Summary & Progress Update
- Record ARNs, filing dates, and Challan CIN numbers into `work/progress.md`.
- Provide final filing certificate summary.

## Agentic Statutory Self-Updating

Whenever a new CBIC notification or GST Council advisory is issued:
1. **Live Discovery:**
   ```bash
   uv run python3 scripts/fetch_live_compliance.py
   ```
2. **Apply & Verify Patch:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/compliance_radar.py --apply patch.json
   ```
   The engine stages the threshold changes in `config/rules_manifest.json`, runs all 39 test suites and invariant fuzzers, and commits the update only if 100% pass (with automatic rollback on failure).
